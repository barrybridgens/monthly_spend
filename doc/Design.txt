Monthly Spend

The aim is to calculate how much regular spending is still pending before pay day

The input will be a file containing regular transactions. This will show the transaction name and payment schedule and optionally the current balance

The schedule must be the date of the month and an indication of which months the payment is valid for. One line per payment

<day number> one or two digits
<space>
<valid flags> Twelve digits - either 0 or 1 (where 1 means valid)
<space>
<name of transaction>

eg.
15 100100100100 Gas Bill

The output will be a number indicating either the amount still to be spent or, if the balance is provided, the amount left at pay day
